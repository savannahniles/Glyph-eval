			<p class="title">HELLO!</p>

			<p>Thank you for participating in this evaluation. The study should take about 20 minutes. Before you begin, please read through these instructions, then the consent information. When you are finished, you can click "Agree and begin" if you agree to participate.</p>

			<p class="title">INSTRUCTIONS</p>

			<p>You're about to look at 20 images, one at a time. Some of them are still images, and some of them are animated gifs. Each image was made from a YouTube video. For every image, you can choose to view the YouTube video that it comes from by simply clicking the image, but you don't have to. When you're ready to move onto the next video, click the 'Next' button.</p>

		
			<p class="title">CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERVIEW</p>


			<p>You have been asked to participate in a research study conducted by Savannah Niles from the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The purpose of the study is to investigate types of video thumbnails and their effect on the user's interest in the video they preview. The results of this study will be included in Savannah Niles’ masters thesis. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you volunteered to participate. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to participate. </p>

			<ul>

			<li>This interview is voluntary. You have the right to stop the interview at any time or for any reason. I expect that the interview will take about 20 minutes. </li>

			<li>You will not be compensated for this interview.</li>

			<li>The information collected as you move through the survey will include time to complete study and images clicked, and this information will be confidential. No other information will be collected. </li>

			</ul>

			<p>This project will be completed by April 30th. All data will potentially be included in the thesis, but raw data will be destroyed within 6 months of the study’s completion.</p>

			<p>If after the study you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, M.I.T., Room E25-143b, 77  Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, phone 1-617-253-6787.</p>
